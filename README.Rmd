## Example

Here is a basic example of a very controversial type of plot but that anyway can be useful in some situations... the pie chart!:

```{r example}
library(polygons)

piechart(1:10, density=(1:10)^2/2, slice.off = (1:10)/30, doughnut = .5,
  radius = sqrt(10:1),
  # Here we are setting random labels...
  labels=sapply(1:10, function(x) paste(sample(letters, x, TRUE), collapse=""))
  )
```
